    <h1>Who are the Secret service</h1>

    <p class="error">The term "Secret Service" typically refers to government agencies responsible
        for providing security and protection to high-ranking government officials and
        investigating various types of crimes, particularly financial crimes.
        One of the most well-known Secret Service agencies is the United States Secret
        Service, which I previously mentioned. However, many countries have their own
        respective secret service or security agencies with different names</p>

        <h2>Secret service available for hire</h2>
        <p class="rouge">Protecting High-Ranking Officials: The primary mission of the U.S. Secret Service is to protect
            the
            President, Vice President, and other high-ranking government officials. They also provide security for
            visiting foreign dignitaries.

            Counterfeit Currency: The Secret Service was originally established in 1865 with the primary mission of
            investigating and combating counterfeit currency. They have a long history of investigating financial
            crimes.

            Criminal Investigations: In addition to their protective role, the Secret Service investigates a wide range
            of financial and electronic crimes, including credit card fraud, identity theft, and cybercrimes.

            Electronic Crimes: With the growth of technology, the Secret Service plays a significant role in
            investigating and preventing electronic crimes, including hacking and cyberattacks.

            Field Offices: The Secret Service has field offices throughout the United States and abroad. These offices
            investigate various types of financial crimes and provide support for protection missions.

            Training: Secret Service agents undergo rigorous training in areas such as marksmanship, defensive tactics,
            and emergency medicine. They are well-prepared to respond to a variety of security threats.

            Uniformed Division: The Secret Service also has a Uniformed Division responsible for security at the White
            House, the Vice President's residence, and other designated locations. They are the first line of defense in
            protecting these sites.

            Presidential Campaigns: During presidential campaigns, the Secret Service provides protection for candidates
            who meet certain criteria. Once a candidate becomes the party's nominee, they receive full protection.

            Protective Measures: The Secret Service employs a variety of protective measures, including advance teams,
            intelligence gathering, and security details. They are responsible for ensuring the safety of those under
            their protection.

            Notable Incidents: The Secret Service has faced scrutiny and criticism at times, especially in the case of
            security breaches or incidents involving those they protect. Notable incidents include the assassination of
            President William McKinley and multiple assassination attempts on other
            Presidents.</p>

    <h3>Senior officers</h3>
    <p>Director of the United States Secret Service: This is the highest-ranking position in the agency. The Director is
        responsible for overseeing all aspects of the Secret Service's mission, including protection, investigation, and
        administrative functions.

        Deputy Director: The Deputy Director is the second-highest-ranking officer in the Secret Service and assists the
        Director in managing the agency's day-to-day operations.

        Assistant Directors: The Secret Service has several Assistant Directors, each responsible for specific divisions
        or functions within the agency. These divisions may include the Protective Mission, the Investigative Mission,
        Human Resources, and more.

        Special Agents in Charge (SACs): SACs are responsible for overseeing field offices and operational activities
        within their regions. They report to the Assistant Directors and are responsible for coordinating protection and
        investigative efforts.

        President's residence, and other designated locations. They are responsible for the safety of these sites.

        positions within the agency, including SES members who head various divisions and functions, such as the Office
        of Investigations or the Office of Protective Operations.

        Please note that the composition of senior officers may change over time due to appointments, retirements, or
        reassignments. For the most current information on the leadership of the United States Secret Service, I
        recommend visiting the official website of the U.S. Secret Service or consulting official government sources.
